You choose to take the path on the right. As you make your way down the path, you begin
to hear the sound of rushing water in the distance. As you approach the clearing, you see
a beautiful waterfall cascading down the rocks. It's a breathtaking sight.

Suddenly, you hear a faint voice calling out for help from behind the waterfall. It sounds
like someone is in trouble.

Decision time: What will you do?

1. Investigate the voice and try to find a way behind the waterfall.

2. Ignore the voice and continue exploring the clearing.

3. Approach the waterfall cautiously and try to identify the source of the voice before
deciding what to do.
